# CodeRefinery pre-workshop survey

Participants of CodeRefinery workshops are asked to fill a pre-workshop
survey before attending the workshop. In this survey we collect information
on previous experience with various tools and programming practices.

The survey includes the questions [listed here](questions/questions.md).
They are also recorded in the [questions/survey.json](questions/survey.json) file.

## Questions which we have not analyzed (yet)

- Gender: we used to ask this in the first year(s) but we asked it in a too binary way and at some point we stopped asking this question
- Distribution of responses over time
- Joing plot: academic disciplines and positions
- For most questions old Typeform answers are not included in the answers since the CSV form is inconvenient and I ran out of time
