Until now, I just really used matlab (python and fortran just for making code by others run to use it), but outside a program i'm lost in infrastructure that I don't really know /understand. It also would be awesome to start understanding how to effectively work kind of simultaneous on one Project.    One Problem might be that I'm a total beginner in Linux and git and python etc. and know very few of the Handy Tools that are available. So finally, I hope to get to know to some of those tools. :)"
