I have never been formally trained in any way. I still view my programming needs as very utilitarian--it's a tool to do the analyses/visualizations that  I want to do, not an end goal in and of itself--but I want to learn more best practices for two main reasons: 1) reproducibility. I want to start publicly sharing the code associated with my projects, and so I want it to be something other people can interpret and easily work with; 2) I work much more collaboratively now than I used to, so I want to understand how to code collaboratively and how to review each others' code as we work through a project."
