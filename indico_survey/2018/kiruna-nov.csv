I'm also curious about the wider community and what, if anything, might be available in the Nordic academic community. Maintaining version control, bug tracking, code review, automated testing, etc. infrastructure is a real task in itself and I'm curious if there is anyway of sharing that as we only have a small team at EISCAT and don't have time for everything. But that might be a foolish notion."
